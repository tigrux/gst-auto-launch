gst-auto-launch is an improved version of gst-launch that accepts commands.

Usage: ./gst-auto-launch <pipelines.xml> <pipeline_id> <commands>
Where each command is of the form <seconds>:<name>
Supported commands are:
  pause:
    Change pipeline state to PAUSED
  null:
    Change pipeline state to NULL
  ready:
    Change pipeline state to READY
  play:
    Change pipeline state to PLAYING
  eos:
    Send eos to the source elements
  quit:
    Quit the event loop

If no xml file can be parsed, it will get the pipeline
from the command line.

Examples:
gst-auto-launch pipelines.xml videotest 0:pause 1:play +5:eos
gst-auto-launch videotestsrc ! autovideosink 0:pause 1:play +5:eos
